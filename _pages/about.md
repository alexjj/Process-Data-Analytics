#### Chemical Engineer. Computer Science Hobbyist. Dad.
![me](/images/me.jpg)

I enjoy using data to solve problems, and I like learning new things. This website is a way for me to learn new things by writing about them. It's very much focused on data analysis for process engineers who are responsible for improving plants and facilities, but the methods and tools likely apply to many industries.

I'm very fond of tea â˜•.
